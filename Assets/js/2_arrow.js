EXERCISE NUMBER 2:

Transform the following function into a one-line arrow function. This exercise should be placed in a file named `2_arrow.js`.

<code>
let suma = function(a, b){
return a + b
}
</code>

*/


/* ARROW FUNCTION: */

const suma = (a, b) => a + b;

/* 
Within Arrow functions, when it's a single line, the return is implicit.  

It's almost always a function expression, with easyer sintaxis, without hoisting that means is not hoisted, so we can't use them untill they aren't defined.

Alwas it has to stare it into a variable or any other value.
